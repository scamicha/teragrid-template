\begin{abstract}

  We propose to use XSEDE's unique computational and storage resources, namely large shared memory systems and wide area
  file system, to conduct three dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks with embedded
  objects. The SGI Altix UV systems in XSEDE are particularly well suited for our code, CHYMERA, because it is OpenMP
  parallel and scales to 128 cores. We also propose to continue and extend previous work under a TeraGrid research
  grant, which enabled us to utilize wide area networked (WAN) file systems to streamline our workflow and increase
  productivity. With the awarded allocation we will conduct a suite of simulations using the CHYMERA code to further our
  understanding of the effects of gravitational instabilities (GIs) on planet migration in protoplanetary disks. In
  addition, we will use the new functionality of the CHYMERA code to simulate circumbinary disks to understand how GIs
  might behave in a binary system.

\section{Planet Formation in Protoplanetary Disks}
\label{sec:intro}

There are two major theories of gas giant planet formation which are currently being considered, core accretion and disk
instability. It is well known that gas giant planets form in the disks of infalling material surrounding a forming, or
protostars. These disks are known as protoplanetary disks. In the core accretion picture \citep{mizuno1980}, a large
solid core must first build up through the collision of rocky materials in the disk. When this core grows to several
Earth masses, it gravitationally attracts the surrounding gas to form a gas giant planet. Observational estimates of
disk lifetimes range from 0.1 to 10 Myr, \citep{haisch2001,chen2004} with an average lifetime of $\sim 3$ Myr. Although
extreme ages exist, an upper limit of 10 Myr is generally agreed upon. Simulations by \citet{pollack1996} found that
core accretion could produce a gas giant planet $\sim 8$ Myr after kilometer-sized planetesimals have formed. However,
the core masses ($M_{core}$) of the planets produced by these simulations ($\sim 15 M_{\oplus}$) are outside the range
of Jupiter's core mass (0--11 $M_{\oplus}$) inferred from the Jovian gravitational moments and detailed equation of
state calculations \citep{saumon2004}. The large range of possible $M_{core}$ is due to uncertainties in the equation of
state (EOS) of hydrogen and helium at megabar pressures. \citet{saumon2004} found the most likely values of $M_{core}$
to be $\leq 5 M_{\oplus}$. This leads to several possibilities: (1) Core accretion can occur for $M_{core} \leq 5
M_{\oplus}$, (2) Jupiter formed with a more massive core which was then dispersed into Jupiter's outer layers, or (3)
Jupiter did not form via core accretion. More recent work by \citet{hub2005} and \citet{papa2005} have addressed the
first point by demonstrating that a gas giant planet can form via core accretion with $M_{core}=5 M_{\oplus}$ in 4.5 Myr
and 3 Myr, respectively. However, for these simulations the authors have used dust grain opacities of 2\% and 1\% of the
interstellar value. When the dust grain opacity is set to the interstellar value, gas giants form in 95 Myr and 30
Myr. Forming kilometer-sized planetesimals needed to build the cores may be difficult due the effects of
migration. Planetesimals must grow from small dust grains in the gas disk which is accreting into the central
star. Since the particles are strongly affected by gas drag until they reach sizes of tens of meters \citep{weiden1977},
they must grow to this size quickly or be accreted into the star.

On the other hand, disk instability \citep{kup1951,cam1978,boss1997} can form dense clumps via gravitational
instabilities (GIs) in times comparable to the dynamic time of the disk ($\lesssim 10^3$ yr). According to the theory,
these clumps are the self-gravitating precursors to gas giant planets. As the clump contracts, the solids contained in
the gas will rain out to form a core \citep{slattery1980}, and the clump can capture more solids from the surrounding
disk \citep{helled2006}. A protoplanetary disk must meet three main requirements to form gas giant planets via disk
instability: (1) GIs must occur in the disk, (2) the GIs must cause the disk to fragment into dense clumps, and (3)
these clumps must survive long enough to become gravitationally bound.

To parameterize the susceptibility of a disk to instability, we consider the Toomre $Q$ parameter \citep{toomre1964},
where $Q = c_s\kappa/\pi G\Sigma$. Here, $c_s$ is the sound speed, $\kappa$ is the epicyclic frequency, and $\Sigma$ the
gas surface density.
%These quantities represent stabilizing and destabilizing influences in the disk. The local pressure acts to stabilize the disk against short wavelengths while the disk rotation acts to stabilize against long wavelengths, while gravity acts to destabilize the disk. 
For $Q \leq 1$, a disk is highly unstable to an axisymmetric ring instability, and spiral instabilities set in at somewhat higher $Q$-values. Numerical simulations have found that disks with $Q$-values $\sim 1.5$ are marginally unstable \citep{boss2000,pickett2003} and that disks with $Q$-values as high as 2 can sustain instabilities. 
%As  \citet{boss2005} points out, the requirement of $Q = 1$ may lead to the erroneous conclusion that GIs cannot exist in the giant planet forming region of protoplanetary disks \citep{rafikov2005}.  

Even though spiral disturbances due to GIs may exist in a disk, they may not fragment into dense clumps. Whether a disk
will fragment is largely controlled by the cooling time. Isothermal calculations of low-Q disks, representing
instantaneous cooling, tend to form many fragments \citep{boss2000,pickett2003}. Simulations using parameterized cooling
find that the cooling times, with an adiabatic index $\gamma = 5/3$, must be less than about half an orbit time
\citep{gammie2001,rice2003b,mejia2005}. However, recent simulations have found that a disk with $\gamma = 7/5$ may
fragment with cooling times as long as two disk orbits \citep{rice2005}. Regardless of the EOS, simulations
using more realistic radiative physics find that cooling times are too long to form fragments
\citep{cai2006,cai2008,boley2006,boley2007b}. Although this position is supported by analytic arguments
\citep{rafikov2005,rafikov2007}, the fragmentation of disks with real radiative cooling remains controversial
\citep{boss2007,mayer2007,durisen2007}.

Once fragments form, they must survive long enough to become bound by self-gravity. Although many clump forming
simulations have found clump lifetimes of many disk orbits \citep{boss2003,rice2003b,mayer2004}, other
simulations find that the clumps are destroyed by the shearing motion of the disk
\citep{pickett2003,mejia2005}. Although some of this discrepancy may be due to different numerical methods
\citep{pickett2007}, simulations using the same code show clump destruction and survival also depend on the physical
conditions in the disk. Obviously the particulars of a disk (EOS, mass, temperature, opacity, etc.)
play a pivotal role in all aspects of the disk instability theory. Give the existing difficulties with both theories,
some authors have proposed hybrid theories where GIs assist planetesimal formation and accelerate core accretion
\citep{hag2003b,rice2004,durisen2005}.

\section{Gravitational Instabilities and\\ Planet Migration}
\label{sec:migration}

To date simulations published by our group have primarily focused on the question of whether gas giant planets can form
directly via gravitational instability. We have also studied the effects of GIs on global disk properties such as
surface density, mass transport and non-axisymmetric structure. Regardless of how a gas giant planet forms, whether by
core accretion, gravitational instability, or a hybrid of the two, another interesting question is what happens to a
protoplanet after it has formed and before the disk dissipates.  Linear analysis \citep{ward1997,tanaka2002} as well as
numerical simulations \citep{nelson2003,nelson2004} indicate that in a laminar disk, or a disk dominated by MHD
turbulence, planets tend to migrate inward rapidly via type I or type II migration, depending on their mass, and are
accreted onto the central star within a few $\times 10^5$ years. In the case of type I migration, the protoplanet is not
massive enough to open a gap in the disk and migrates inward by exchanging angular momentum with the disk via
gravitational torques. With type II migration the protoplanet is massive enough to open a gap and then migrates with the
motion of the surrounding disk. In either case, the timescale for the protoplanet to migrate into the central star is
very short compared to disk lifetimes. However, if the disk is gravitationally unstable, the instabilities may slow
inward migration, or even cause the protoplanet to move outward. This would help to explain how protoplanets can survive
in a protoplanetary disk after they form as well as provide insight into their distributions in multiple planet systems,
53 of which have already been discovered. So far, the study of migration in gravitationally unstable disks has been
focused on the context of fragmented disks \citep{mayer2004,boss2005}. However, new studies are emerging focusing on
planet migration in non-fragmenting gravitationally unstable disks \citep{michael2011b, baruteau2011}.

Additions made to our code prior to our 08-09 award allowed us to follow the motion of massive particles in
protoplanetary disks undergoing GIs. We were also able to model the effect of a massive planet on the disk and the
feedback between the planet and GIs. By examining a range of masses ($0.3 M_{\mathrm{jup}}$ -- $3 M_{\mathrm{jup}}$), we
have been studying how GIs affect gap opening, the transition between type I and type II migration, the effect of GIs on
type I migration rates, whether GIs might be able to halt inward migration, and the effect of a massive planet on the
onset of GIs.

  and the density scale is logarithmic. The white X indicates the position of the system COM in the accelerated frame,
  and the black diamond indicates the position of the planet. \label{fig:modes}}
\end{figure}

\section{Computational Methodology}
\label{sec:method}

The equations of hydrodynamics and self-gravity are:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \rho \boldsymbol{v} & = & 0,\label{massconteq}\\
\frac{\partial \rho \boldsymbol{v}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \rho \boldsymbol{vv} & = & -\nabla p - \rho \nabla \Phi_{\mathrm{tot}}\nonumber\\
&& - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathsf{Q}),\label{motioneq}\\
\frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \epsilon & = & - p \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v} + \Gamma - \Lambda,\label{energyeq}\\
\nabla^2 \Phi_{\mathrm{disk}} & = & 4 \pi G \rho\label{graveq}.
\end{eqnarray}
These are the mass continuity equation \eqref{massconteq}, the equation of motion \eqref{motioneq}, the internal energy equation \eqref{energyeq}, and Poisson's equation \eqref{graveq}. Here $\rho$ is the mass density, $\mathbf{v}$ represents the gas velocity, $p$ is the gas pressure, $\mathsf{Q}$ is the artificial viscosity tensor, $\epsilon$ is the internal energy density, $\Gamma$ represents heating due to artificial viscosity, $\Lambda$ represents net cooling due to energy transport via radiation or other mechanisms, and $\Phi_{\mathrm{tot}}$ and $\Phi_{\mathrm{disk}}$ are the total and disk gravitational potentials, respectively.

The Indiana University Hydro Group (IUHG) code, CHYMERA, is an Eulerian scheme which is second order in both space and
time. The equations are evolved in cylindrical coordinates ($\varpi$,$\phi$,$z$) on an evenly spaced three dimensional
grid. The rotation axis of the disk is aligned with the $z$-axis. The disk is treated as having reflection symmetry about
the midplane in order to reduce computation time. Poisson's equation is solved via Fourier decomposition and cyclic
reduction \citep{tohline1980}. Shock heating is modeled via artificial viscosity \citep{pickettphd1995} and radiative
cooling is treated by a method outlined in the following section. Artificial viscosity is treated using a von
Neumann-type scheme \citep{norman1986} in which the off-diagonal terms of the artificial viscosity tensor are set to
zero and the heating due to artificial viscosity is given by
 \begin{equation}
 \Gamma = \rho(\mathsf{Q}_{rr}\partial_r v_r + \mathsf{Q}_{\phi\phi} r^{-1}\partial_\phi v_\phi + \mathsf{Q}_{zz} \partial_z v_z). 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Cooling Algorithm}
\label{sec:cooling}

The cooling algorithm used in CHYMERA, as implemented by \citet{boley2007b}, is a radiative routine where the transport
of energy by radiation in the vertical direction is computed using the method of discrete ordinates
\citep{chandra1960}. Here each vertical column is considered to be a separate plane parallel structure, and the transfer
is calculated using a single upward ray at $\mu = 1/\sqrt{3}$ to the vertical and a single downward ray at $\mu =
-1/\sqrt{3}$, where $\mu$ is the cosine of the angle between the ray and the disk vertical . For optical depths greater
than $\tau = 1/\sqrt{3}$, transport in the $\varpi$ and $\phi$ directions is treated using flux-limited diffusion. No
transport is modeled in the $\varpi$ and $\phi$ directions for $\tau < 1/\sqrt{3}$. The advantage of this scheme is that
the vertical transport is modeled explicitly, no fitting of an atmosphere is required and cell-to-cell coupling is
included explicitly for all $\tau$.

  simulations. The lines represent the radial position at each time while the diamonds show the semi-major axis for each
  orbit centered at the temporal midpoint of the orbit. The black dashed line represents the type I estimated migration
  rate for a 1 MJ planet.}
\label{fig:planetmotion}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Planet Integrator}
\label{sec:planetintegrate}

In order to model the effect of GIs on the migration of protoplanets and planets, routines have been added to the
standard version of the code to follow the motion of massive particles in a GI-active background. The simplest
second-order accurate scheme to implement is the leapfrog scheme, sometimes known as the Verlet method. It has been
shown to be the simplest example of a symplectic integrator \citep{channell1990,yoshida1990} and produces high accuracy
and stability when compared with other second-order integrators such as Runge-Kutta methods. Generally the equations are
written in a time-interleaved fashion with the positions $\boldsymbol{r}$ and accelerations $\boldsymbol{a}$ specified
on the integer time steps and the velocities $\boldsymbol{v}$ specified on the half-integer steps as in
\begin{subequations}
\label{leapfrog}
\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{r}_1 &=& \boldsymbol{r}_0 + \boldsymbol{v}_{1/2} \Delta t\\
\hspace{-.25in} \mathrm{and} \hspace{.25in} \boldsymbol{v}_{3/2} &=& \boldsymbol{v}_{1/2} + \boldsymbol{a}_1 \Delta t.
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
Note that the displacement of $\boldsymbol{v}$ with respect to $\boldsymbol{r}$ and $\boldsymbol{a}$ is time symmetric, preventing the accumulation of error in the energy over time.


\subsection{Code Testing}
\label{sec:tests}

Extensive testing of the hydrodynamic routines and radiative routines has been performed by several researchers in the
IUHG \citep{yangphd1992,pickettphd1995,pickett2000,pickett2003,mejia2005,boley2007b}. In order to test the planet
integration and interpolation algorithms included in the code, simulations were performed in which an initial
axisymmetric disk was held fixed while a planet orbited in its potential. Since the mass distribution of the
protoplanetary disk used is not a simple one, results could not be compared to analytic solutions. However the $z$
component of the angular momentum was conserved to one part in $10^{13}$ and the expected rosette pattern was observed
in the orbit, which maintained nearly constant apapse and periapse radii.

\subsection{Studies in Planet Migration} \label{sec:migplan}

Several gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disk studies have been carried out under previous TeraGrid awards granted
to PI Richard H. Durisen. Namely, TeraGrid awards TG-AST080031T and TG-AST090027, which resulted in several publications
\citep{henschel2010,michael2010a,michael2010b,michael2011a} in both the astronomical sciences and in computer
science. With the current request for XSEDE, we plan to extend and expand upon this work. Under PI Scott Michael, we
have already received a startup award (TG-AST110027) that has been put to great use, allowing for benchmarking of the
code on the new Altix UV architecture and submission of an article to Astrophysical Journal Letters, a peer-reviewed
express scientific journal that allows astrophysicists to rapidly publish short notices of significant original research
\citep{michael2011b}. Under our previous awards we planned to study the effect of both planet mass and planet position
on migration in a GI-active disk. Subsequently, we realized an additional interesting study would be to understand the
effect a planet might have on a marginally stable disk. For this reason we undertook a series of seven simulations to
study the effects of planet mass and the effect of injecting the planet at different stages in the evolution of the
disk. Figure \ref{fig:modes} is an example of midplane and meridional density contours from one such simulation.

We plan to continue our work by following up our studies on planet mass with a study of how injection position affects
migration rates and GI activity. Our current studies of GI-active and marginally stable disks have placed planets of
varying mass near the radius where we typically observe the co-rotation radii of the dominant GI active modes. We will
follow up on these studies by injecting varying mass planet outside the co-rotation radii of the dominant modes to
determine whether the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) of the dominant modes can play a significant role in planet
migration. By placing the planet at the outer Linblad resonance of the strongest mode \citep{binney1987}, we hope to
understand how sensitive the planet's motion is to its location relative to the dominate GI modes and when its direction
can change.

Simulations conducted under the previous award have led to several interesting discoveries, which will be submitted to a
leading astronomical journal in the near future. The first discovery is the fact that GIs can, in fact, reverse the
direction of type I migration for a 0.3 $M_J$ planet. Figure \ref{fig:planetmotion} shows the radial location of each of
three planets inserted into a GI active disk. The blue curve represents the 0.3 $M_J$ planet simulation. One can clearly
see, that the planet has moved outward from its initial position of 25 AU to nearly 40 AU over the course of $\sim 10$
ORP ($\approx 1800$ years). Although other mechanisms for outward migration have been suggested
\citep{paardekooper2010,paardekooper2011}, no one has yet demonstrated that GIs can drive outward migration, and
alternative mechanisms are not this dramatic or robust. The second interesting discovery is that inward migration
appears to halt for the 1 $M_J$ and 3 $M_J$ planets at 18 AU and 15 AU, respectively. We have hypothesized that this
could be due to the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) of the dominant GI modes in the disk. However, as the planets have
only been in the region for a few ORP, these simulations must be extended to either confirm that the GIs truly halt
inward migration, or show that they merely stall it.

Another interesting result of work conducted under the previous award was the finding that upon injecting planets at the
beginning of our simulations, the presence of the planet affects the onset of GI activity causing the co-rotation of the
dominant mode to shift outward. We will conduct further tests by injecting planets at different locations at the
beginning of the simulations to study how the planet's initial position affects the onset of GIs.

Estimates for the resolution requirements were based on the planet's Hill radius. In order to capture the gravitational
effect of the planet, one would like to resolve the Hill sphere with many resolution elements, at minimum one resolution
element in 25 per cent of the Hill sphere. So ideally we would have,
\begin{equation}
\Delta \phi \varpi = 0.25\varpi \sqrt[3]{\frac{m_{\mathrm{planet}}}{3M_{\mathrm{star}}}}.
\end{equation}
For our least massive planet this gives a $\phi$-resolution of $~ 520$ resolution elements. We have conducted
simulations using a resolution of 512x512x64 ($\varpi$,$\phi$,$z$) with this planet mass and have not detected any
numerical effects due to inadequate resolution. We will continue to use this resolution for our further simulations.

\subsection{Studies of Circumbinary Disks}\label{sec:binary}

In addition to allowing us to simulate the inclusion of massive planets in a protoplanetary disk, the code improvement
described in \S\ref{sec:planetintegrate} also enable the simulation of circumbinary disks with large mass ratios. We
have begun a simulation with a 1 $M_\odot$ primary star with a 20 $M_J$ binary companion. This simulation represents a
solar type star with close brown dwarf binary companion. Preliminary results indicate very interesting GI behavior and
strong feedback between the GI spiral structures and the binary system. Unfortunately, the action of the binary
accelerates material near the $z$ axis, increasing the sound speed where the Courant condition is determined. This has
the overall effect of decreasing the physical time of the time step, requiring a factor of 4 more time steps to complete
the same amount of physical time when compared to an embedded planet simulation. Even so, the current simulation has
progressed to nearly 10 ORP. We propose to conduct several similar simulations for comparison by varying the binary mass
fraction and the binary separation. 

\subsection{Advancement of Astrophysical Workflows, Wide Area File Systems, and TeraGrid
  Cyberinfrastructure}\label{sec:CI}

To deliver scientifically valid results from simulations performed with CHYMERA, the simulation data must go through a
series of processing steps. We have worked over the past several years to streamline and automate the post-processing
workflow and produce final, publishable results as quickly as possible. The typical workflow has several steps
including: simulation, visualization, Fourier analysis, periodogram analysis, and torque analysis. These analyses are
accompanied by several ancillary basic analyses like temperature and density structure, effective cooling times, and
Toomre $Q$ parameters. The different stages in this workflow encompass a variety of computational resource and software
demands, and each stage can be run at different sites. 

To facilitate using different computational resources at different sites for the various stages of the workflow, we have
been using the TeraGrid wide area file system, the Data Capacitor. Simulation data from shared memory machines at PSC or
NCSA is written directly to the file system, which is housed at Indiana University. Visualization scripts, written in
the Interactive Data Language (IDL), immediately execute on local campus resources, providing the researcher with an
instant interactive look at the data as it is produced. Analysis routines, which are MPI parallel, are then executed on
a distributed memory cluster that mounts the Data Capacitor. This can be either a TeraGrid or non-TeraGrid resource
\citep{michael2010b}, and effectively shifts this workload off of the shared memory machines, so that they can be
reserved for programs that truly need the shared memory capabilities.

This workflow model has served our research group quite well for some time \citep{henschel2010,michael2010b}, and we
would prefer to preserve it. Currently, the Data Capacitor is mounted at NCSA (Ember) and PSC (Pople). Preliminary tests
indicate a 5\% overhead on Ember for writing data to the Data Capacitor versus writing directly to the local GPFS
scratch space. This relatively minor overhead is more than made up for by the cost to transfer the data from one site to
another. We anticipate that the Data Capacitor will be made available on the Altix UV at PSC (Blacklight) soon.

\section{Service Unit Request and Justification}
\label{sec:performance}

Planned simulations include three simulations studying planet position in a GI-active disk, three simulations studying the effect of
planet injection position in an initially GI-inactive disk, and several simulations studying circumbinary disks. In
total we plan 8--10 simulations at this resolution each of which should be evolved for at least 10--20 ORPs, which is roughly equal to
1--2 million time steps. In addition, we will extend the evolution of previously studied disks to determine whether GIs
have permanently halted inward migration or merely stalled it for some time.

Our previous estimates for the required SUs to complete simulations with planets were quite accurate on the Altix 4700
systems of PSC and NCSA. Extensive testing of the
code's scalability on several Altix 4700 machines has been conducted under the previous award's ASTA component. To date, we
have evolved an aggregate of ~15 million production time steps and several million time steps in testing and
development. Combined, these simulations have used nearly 600,000 SUs on TeraGrid shared memory machines. Since the
Altix UV has dramatically improved capabilities over the 4700 series, we repeated our benchmarking on the new system
(namely NCSA's Ember) to determine the SU/time step ratio.  These  measurements have shown that we require
43,520 SUs on an Altix UV (such as Blacklight or Ember) to perform 1 million simulation time steps at a
resolution of 512x512x64 ($\varpi$,$\phi$,$z$) using 128 OpenMP threads. In total, to complete the 8--10
simulations we are planning, each averaging $\approx 2,000,000$ time steps, we will need $(10\times2\times43,520)$ =
870,400 SUs. We request 1,000,000 SUs to provide a 13\% contingency, on a combination of the Altix UVs at PSC and NCSA.

\subsection{Storage Request}\label{sec:storage}

Each simulation produces 5--10 TB of raw data, with a few TB of reduced data being produced by the analysis and
visualization. Currently, the data produced by simulations is being written to the Data Capacitor. As it is no longer an
allocatable resource in XSEDE, we request 40 TB of short to medium term storage space on Albedo, the wide area file
system. When possible, we will continue to utilize the Data Capacitor, but will test the capabilities of Albedo to
determine if it can fill a similar role in our workflow. 

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary} 

We seek to carry out a suite of numerical simulations to study the effects of GIs on planetary migration and in
circumbinary disks. These simulations would take a prohibitively long time using our currently available campus resources. In
order to carry out our work in a reasonable amount of time, we request 1,000,000 SUs of Altix UV time.
